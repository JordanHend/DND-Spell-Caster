DND Spell Caster

Just a program i wrote really quick to help cast scorching ray in a DND campaign i'm in.

See @spells.h for how casting of spells is done.
and @main.cpp for how I output the text to the OS

Probably should make a GUI for it or something but it just unleashes scorching ray on a backspace press.

So, just run the program, click on a chat window (discord, skype, notepad, whatever) and hit backspace.. it'll fill it with the info, and all you have to do is hit send.
